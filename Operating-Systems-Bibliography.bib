  abstract = {This paper presents the EPOS approach to bring object-oriented operating
	systems closer to high performance parallel applications. The gap
	between them originates from the complexity of assembling an operating
	system out of a complex collection of complex classes. EPOS aims
	to deliver, whenever possible automatically, a customized runtime
	support system for each application. In order to achieve this, EPOS
	introduces the concepts of scenario-independent system abstractions,
	scenario adapters and inflated interfaces. An application designed
	and implemented following the guidelines behind these concepts can
	be submitted to a tool that will proceed syntactical and data flow
	analysis to extract a blueprint for the operating system. This blueprint
	is then refined by dependency analysis against information about
	the execution scenario acquired from the user via visual tools. The
	outcome of this process is a set of selective realize keys that will
	support the generation of the application-oriented operating system.}

  abstract = {Roughly speaking, we can divide the history of modern computing into
	the following eras: d 1970s: Timesharing (1 computer with many users)
	d 1980s: Personal computing (1 computer per user) d 1990s: Parallel
	computing (many computers per user) Until about 1980, computers were
	huge, expensive, and located in computer centers. Most organizations
	had a single large machine. In the 1980s, prices came down to the
	point where each user could have his or her own personal computer
	or workstation. These machines were often networked together, so
	that users could do remote logins on other people's computers or
	share files in various (often ad hoc) ways. Nowadays some systems
	have many processors per user, either in the form of a parallel computer
	or a large collection of CPUs shared by a small user community. Such
	systems are usually called parallel or distributed computer systems.
