Overview
========

Instructions
============

Conduct a short literature review on the topic of *Operating Systems
Design, implementation and Applications*. Identify relevant journal
papers and create a bibliography, e.g Bibtex (or whatever you prefer) UB
online library resources and science direct
(http://www.sciencedirect.com/), IEEExplore
(http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/), citeseerx (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/)
etc. are a good start.\
Key standard operating systems textbooks like
[@osDesignImpTanenbaum1997], [@osInternalsAndDesignStallings1996] also
offer further reading on key publications on operating systems
internals, design principles and implementation considering case studies
like MINIX, Solaris, SVR4 UNIX and Windows NT and other important
operating systems. Advanced operating systems topics are covered in
[@advancedOSSinghal194] and [@centDistOSNutt192] for example

This is a wide subject, your literature review does not have to cover
all ground. It may be useful to consider some developments in the design
and implemetation of an operating system from two views - as a extended
machine/virtual machine and a resource manager considering some of the
design and implementation issues in regards to the following

-   Multiprogramming

-   Processes and Threads- e.g consider advanced concepts like
    Threading, Symmetric Multiprocessing, Microkernels etc

-   Memory Management and Virtual Memory

-   Concurrency

-   Scheduling

-   Security, protection and isolation

The discussion can cover issues, solutions, algorithms and key
publications on these.\
It may also be interesting to look at design concepts like Object
Orientation [@ooadBooch1994] and its benefit to the design of Operating
Systems e.g better organisation of inherent complexity, reduced
development effort, more extesible and maintanable systems.\
Also with proliferation of networks [@dataCommsStallings1997], clusters
[@clustersPfister1997], distributed systems [@princDSGarg1996] - there
is an active area of distributed operating systems, considering
Distributed Computing [@DCSCavasant1994] in managing complexity and
presenting standard operating systems abstractions to users and
applications, e.g distributed process managenment including process
migration as discussed in [@procMigrationEskicioglu1990] and associated
algorithms as discussed in [@dosSingha1997] and [@dapRaynal1988] . There
are a number of prototype distributed operating systems, and associated
global and distributed file systems etc. There are a lot of publications
and surveys on these e.g. [@Tanenbaum92theamoeba], [@dosTanenbaum985]

There is also active area of research around application specific,
embedded systems and operating systems considering contraints and
realtime and other requirements for such platforms and applications, for
example designing for multimedia, mobile devices,high perfomance
computing, cloud

#### Example citing

.\
[@osDesignImpTanenbaum1997] discusses Operating systems design and
implementation seeking to provide a good balance between theory and
practice in the teaching of operatng systems.
[@Frohlich99highperformance] observes that the gap between
object-oriented operating systems and high performance parallel
applications them originates from the complexity of assembling an
operating system out of a complex collection of complex classes and
proposes the EPOCH pproach to address this

LEARNING OUTCOMES
=================

To conduct independent research on a given operating systems topic,
looking at theory, practice, identifying key issues, solutions and
discussion of the state of the art in the field and .\
This exercise also help you acquire Typesetting, referencing and
bibliograhy skills

SUBMISSION
==========

-   Literature review document (No more than 10 pages) with citations
    and references - You can use Latex and Bibtex

-   10 key papers you uncovered and referenced

-   A one page poster

SUBMSSION INSTRUCTIONS

Submit a zip file with all your files for the above at the gven moodle
link

TYPSETTING AND BIBLIOGRAPHY TOOLS
=================================

Consider using the following tools - See links and on Moodle

1.  Latex (you can Miktex - Latex on Windows)

2.  Latex Front End/Editor, e.gTexWorks or an Eclipse plugin (or can
    just use simple editors)

3.  Bibtex and frontend bibliography reference manager e.g Jabref ( or
    can just use simple text editor to populate your bliography)

4.  Example latex templates
